## How it works

🐢🚀 This is a Node.js app! It's powered by:

- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), a platform for running machine learning models in the cloud.
- [Stable Diffusion](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion), an open-source text-to-image generation model.
- Next.js [server-side API routes](pages/api) for talking to the Replicate API
- Next.js React components for the GUI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for Icons

## Development

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed, then:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
